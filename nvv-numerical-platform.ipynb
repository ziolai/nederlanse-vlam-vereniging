    "1. is intended as a means to share information;\n",

    "<b>Goals of a Common Simulation Platform</b>: \n",
    "To bridge the gap between sustainability (fuel reduction, fuel versatility, fuel staging (hydrogen, ammonia, syngas, CO2), oxy-fuel, flameless combustion, pollutant reduction and productivity (productivity closer to specs, design of new products and production processes). Gain understanding of how furnaces should be operated in new conditions (new fuel and/or now oxidizer conditions).

    "\n",
    "The simulation platform is conceptually divided into the following parts: \n",
    "1. pre-processing step: geometry definition, mesh generation, flamelet table generation, parallel decomposition of inputs  and other; \n",
    "2. main computation step: solve reactive flow equations including combustion, radiative heat transfer and heat transfer to solid, liquid or gas phase; \n",
    "3. post-processing step: visualization of results \n",

    "The simulation platform can consist of commercial and public domain components. This components can be used side-by-side in such a way that information gained from various sources reinforces each other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Commercial (Closed Source) Software \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advantages</b>: Commercial packages are robust (fail-save) and are equiped with a graphical user interface. They do remain very valuable as a tool for comparision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disvantages</b>: Commercial (off-the-shelf, closed source) software packages implement off-the-shelf models that might be ill-suited to tacke new needs in the energy transition. The use of use-defined functions allows some degree of customization. The public debate on this customization is hampered by the propriety nature of the software. The propriety nature of the software furthermore places its deployment behind closed doors (e.g. no hardware-specific (GPU) compilation, no linking with vendor-specific libraries, no profiling, no debugging) and limits its use on already existing and emerging hardware). To tackle new challenges, the shift to new tools might be required;\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Examples</b>: Examples include Ansys-Fluent (in use at e.g. Danieli-Corus, De Jong and XRG-Technologies) and ConvergeCFD;   \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Choice for OpenFoam \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advantages</b>: Extensive experience at TU Eindhoven, TU Delft (Mechnical Engineering, Math and Aerospace) and Shell (see [example](https://journal.openfoam.com/index.php/ofj/article/view/125)), the choice for OpenFoam is a natural choice. OpenFoam allows computations on parallel computing hardware without license costs;  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disvantages</b>: OpenFoam lacks components such as e.g. robust and computationally coupled pressure-velocity solver, steady-state reactive flow solver and supported flamelet solver including flamelet tables; \n",
