# Combura-2023 Industrial Workshop 

Session promoting dialogue between academia and industry during [Combura2023](https://www.combura.nl) on Tuesday, October 24th, 2023.  

Workshop session on industrial problems 

The session wishes to promote the dialogue between industry and academia. The session will consist of two parts. The first part will features presentation of challenges from three industrial partners. The second part will provide space for exchange between industry and academia. Details will be announced on the website. The session is graciously supported by Danieli-Corus Ijmuiden, Celsian Eindhoven and Oriogen Carbon Solutions.

## Introduction 

Wish to promote dialogue between industry and academia. Therefore session in two parts. 
- Part (1/2): presentation of challenges from three industrial partners. 
- Part (2/2): dialogue between industry and academia on how to address these challenges using a combination of numerical simulation and experimental design approaches.  

## Three Talks from Industry  

Context definition. Problem definition. Suggestions for research.
