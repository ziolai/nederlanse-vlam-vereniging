# Nederlandse Vlam Vereniging - NVV 

## Section 1: New NVV Website

Current version is at [NVV website](http://vlamvereniging.nl/en). This version was developed by [Kiwico](https://www.kiwico.nl/nvv). 

### Wishes in general 
Lean, modular, extensible and easily maintanable website
- only English (no Dutch) pages;
- refer to Linked-Inn for news items; 
- maintain list of news items on website as repository;
- merge NVV website and Combura website and allow payment of registration via IDEAL? 

How should webpages be structured (top down approach)?

### General Outline/Structure for new website

What are NVV ambitions/goals/missions for NVV? Change current text into modern and easily accessable text with  broader/modern/timely scope 

Distinguish between simulation (numerical and analytical) and experimental work.

### Organizing comite members
- Harshit Gupta 
- Nijso Beishuizen
- Mark Senden (?)


### Organizing comite tasks 
- Send first (and second) call around

- Make arrangements and fix venue related details like hotel booking, conference room, conference hardware, lunch dinner etc. There's already a PO so you only have to sign it and send it in once we fix the details internally. What we havent discussed with the hotel yet is the cost of cancellation and their rules regarding covid-19; 

- Arrange the Combura website. For this we usually use an external person who sets-up the website in the past years however we have been looking for a new company/person to do this for us as the existing person cannot setup iDEAL as a payment method, only credit cards or paypal; 

- Setup poster designs for call for papers, invitations and especially the master thesis prize. These are also done by an external person so the only work is making the draft text, generally a copy of the old versions and proof read before everything is sent out; 

- arrange poster boards as part of offer from Kontact der Kontinenten;  

### Program comite members (Jim Kok takes a lead in the program committee) 
- Jim Kok
- Ivan Langella
- colleaugue of Ivan at aerospace; 
- Sikke Klein(?): Jim Kok will contact Sikke about program committee
- Mark Tummers: Jim Kok will contact him
- Marko Derkse: Jim Kok will contact him

### Online Registration Fee 

In our last meeting you mentioned Domenico that you have experience with finding new website designers through some portal and asking them to setup a new website for us especially for multiple payment systems. But considering your recent email it seems you don’t remember what we discussed.
 
We need someone who can make a Combura website for us. The website domain I am not sure is owned by NVV or by the person who setup the website for us. But the biggest question is we need a person who can make a website with alternative. They basically need to update this website with the newest info and a new iDEAL payment system.
 
It would be best if we can have a meeting but I don’t have any time before Friday next week. Let me know if that’s fine with you guys or Nijso and Domenico you can go forward without me. I am sure Nijso knows what needs to be achieved.
 
Here is the contact info of our previous website designer
Name: Pyrros Stathis
