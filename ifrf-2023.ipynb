    "## Dialogue Rob Bastiaans -  Greg Kelsall on November 27th, 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Q: Will there be some organizing support from IFRF (mainly from abroad)? Websites, registration etc. A: Yes.  The IFRF admin team can support.  The 2018 IFRF Conference publicity and registration was organised using Eventbrite and the IFRF websites, so I would envisage the same. I will also help with the organising committee \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Q: Is there some script cq planning available? A: Not sure what you mean by this.  Any planning information available from the last 2018 IFRF Conference in Sheffield can be used where available \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Q: When will the date be selected? A: We should fix a date soon.  Notionally around mid October but avoiding clashes with any other events and to suit local constraints (venue availability, NVV team availability etc) \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Q: How many people will be expected to attend? Parallel sessions? A: I understand that past events have had up to 250 attendees. The recent TOTeM in Paris had 110 attendees- the 2023 IFRF Conference will probably be somewhere in between. Yes, I would envisage parallel sessions.\n",
